# nDFVM
A Finite Volume code written in c++
# Description
nDFVM solves the compressible Euler equations using the Local Lax-Fredrichs Method of Kurganov and Taylor (2001). 
By default, the code solves the evolution of two shearing fluids of different densities, resulting in a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
